Feature: Search

  As a site viewer
  I need to be able to perform a keyword search
  So that I can easily find all the indicators related to a topic

  Scenario: Search index includes goals
    Given I am on the homepage
    And I fill in "the search box" with "hunger"
    And I send key "Enter" in "the search box" element
    And I wait 5 seconds
    Then I should see "1 results found"
    And I follow "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture"
    Then I should be on "/2/"

  Scenario: Search index includes indicators
    Given I am on the homepage
    And I fill in "the search box" with "mortality"
    And I send key "Enter" in "the search box" element

    Then I should see "1 results found"
    And I follow "Maternal mortality ratio"
